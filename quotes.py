	"This place is pretty dead... By which I mean, there's nothing to kill.",

	"I'll give you as much mora as you want, so how about we get to sparring? I'm dying of boredom!",

	"Happy birthday, comrade! Anyone you need knocked off their perch today? Let me know. I'll happily oblige..."

quote_morning = [
	"You look well. What's your secret? Care to exchange notes?",

quote_evening = [
	"Whew, dinner was quite the feast. A spot of exercise is in order.",
	"Ah, how time flies. One day, you will see how I conquer the world and crush the thrones of gods beneath my heel. In the meantime... no dying, comrade! Keep yourself alive, haha.",
	"Evening, comrade! Eaten dinner yet? It won't do to starve yourself. Why don't we get some dinner together? My treat!"

quote_night = [
	"Today was great. See you tomorrow, comrade!",
	"This late already? I didn't even notice the time. Good night!",
	"I hope you aren't planning on staying up too late. I need you in top form tomorrow for when we spar!"

quote_chat = [
	"I'm No. 11 of the Fatui Harbingers, codename Childe, but I also go by Tartaglia. And you... Hmm, you too like to cause quite the stir, don't you? Something tells me we're going to get along splendidly.",
	"If it makes me stronger, I'll take it. Vision? Great. Delusion? Don't mind if I do. Heretical teachings from the Abyss? Sign me up.",
	"Where I'm from, if we didn't keep moving, we'd freeze to death. Literally.",
	"Remember, comrade, one day I will conquer the world!",
	"I once ventured deep into the abyss and came face to face with an enormous beast. I don't know its name, all I know is the sight of it chilled me to the bone. But mark my words, one day I will march back in there and behead that beast, and you, comrade, will be my witness!",
	"I am the least adept with a bow. And that is precisely why I must master it.",
	"My pet peeves? Hmm, well, to be honest, I'm far too busy journeying with you and slaying powerful enemies to dwell on such trifling matters.",
	"However far away my motherland may be, we all live under the same sky. That snow-white moon... My family must be able to see it too. I hope my siblings are well... And I hope that they have turned out to be formidable warriors too.",
	"It's been years since I last saw my master. I should hope that next we meet, I'll at least be able to force her to use both hands to beat me...",
	"\"A warrior's strength is like a dome. The bigger the dome, the more opponents he can challenge inside it.\" Hmm, who was it that said this again?",
	"Food is like weaponry. A true warrior never deliberates unduly over their choice of weapon, nor do they do so over the food they eat. Neither should you.",
	"There's plenty of delicious food to sink your teeth into in this world... and plenty of fights to sink your teeth into as well. Life is beautiful.",
	"Tell me, how has Mr. Zhongli been lately? Not bad, you say? Seems he's had no problem acclimating to \"mortal\" life. Hmph, he sure had me fooled. Such a fiasco mustn't be so easily forgiven! The only way to reconciliation is fierce combat! What do you mean I'm no match for him? Hahaha...",
	"The skeletal-white snowscape devours life without leaving any trace. It is the invisible enemy we fight against each day.",
	"Ice fishing and combat follow the same principle. Patience and decisiveness are key. Though having said that... I suppose the same is true of everything in life.",
	"Varka? Just the thought of one day going head-to-head with him in combat, the fabled Knight of Boreas himself, titan of the Knights of Favonius... It makes me buzz with excitement. It's a beautiful life we live in this world.",
	"Ho, I feel like I've gotten stronger! Now, who shall I use as my guinea pig...",
	"Comrade. Make sure you keep training too. Otherwise, who will be left to fight me to the death when the world lies defeated at my feet?",
	"Face me in person, man to man, and I'll always have a chance of beating you. Same goes if you're a deity or a monster from the abyss. But the Harbingers? They are more enamored with their intangible methods, spending their days scheming and maneuvering. This is why we cannot get along.",
	"Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace. And because she made an enemy of the world, I had the chance to become acquainted with you.",
	"A warrior must always be ready to face any challenge with his blade. The outcome of the battle is irrelevant â€” what matters is that you learn from the experience.",
	"I wonder what the rest of the Harbingers are up to? Plotting and scheming on an ever-grander scale, no doubt.",
	"Comrade, a word of advice: Don't go yelling stupid things in the heat of battle. They might sound good in your head, but if you think about it, they make no sense at all. I'm talking about things like, 'I'm on fire!' That's the last thing we want. Fire leaves behind nothing but ashes. And you must survive at all costs.",
	"Comrade, how would you like to join the Fatui? ...Actually, scrap that. With your capabilities, you and I could head-to-head with the Eleven and win. Wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like that.",
	"Ah, I'm sure the Harbingers must know of my dealings with you by now. Oh, I'd love to see the look on their faces... Hahaha...",
	"You wield such powers without owning a Vision... I really am excited to see what you have in store for us... Let's see how far you can go. Just don't go dying on me before you lay it all on the line in our own final battle! I won't allow it!"

quote_8ball = [
	"I'll give you this bag of mora, so just do what you need to, comrade.",
	"Oh, you're asking me comrade? Sure, I don't see why not.",
	"Without a doubt.",
	"Is this a trick question? Of course!",
	"Hmm... As far as I can tell, yes.",
	"Most likely. ...You seen unconvinced... I'm a bit hurt by this skepticism...",
	"I think the chances are pretty good - you should have more faith in yourself comrade.",
	"You seem like you want me to say yes, so let's go with that.",
	"This seems like the part where I should be saying no, which means the answer is definitely yes.",
	"Why are you asking me this...? Well, either way I think the outlook is good.",

	"...how about you ask Zhongli instead?",
	"A-ahaha... How about I tell you later..."
	"Oh my! Look at the time, I have to go... write to Teucer! See you, comrade!",
	"... (Pretending not to hear)",
	"I'm a bit busy, how about you ask me a bit later? ...I'm definitely not running away!",

	"<:childe_oh_no:829471579372388362>",

	"...I hope this is just a joke. Of course not!",
	"Don't hold your breath.",
	"Hahah, no.",
	"I think it'd be best not to hope for much.",
	"I don't think so, comrade. Even you must realize it's doubtful."
